**Notes:**
- Some exercises may have multiple possible matches or may not have an exact Garmin Connect equivalent. The closest available name is used.
- For exercises like "chest press," if "Cable Chest Press" is not available, use "Cable Crossover." This is an approximate match for the cable machine.
- For any exercise not found in Garmin Connect, use the closest match or log as a custom exercise.
- "Target Muscle(s)" are based on the official Garmin Connect list and may include multiple primary muscles if listed.
- "Match Type" indicates whether the mapping is an exact Garmin Connect match or an approximate equivalent.
