## Day 7 – Rest

- Enjoy your rest and recovery!

---

### **Notes for Beginners**
- Start with 2 sets per exercise for your first 2–3 weeks (add a third set as you get comfortable).
- Focus on form and control, not weight.
- Rest 60–90 seconds between sets.
- If a movement feels too hard, do fewer reps or choose an easier variation.
- For exercises like Cable Lateral Raises, prioritize form over weight. You can find many instructional videos online by searching "Cable Lateral Raise form".
- Log these workouts in Garmin Connect using the exact exercise names above.
