# Beginner Weekly Workout Plan (Custom, Garmin Connect Compatible)

**Equipment Used:** Cable Machine, Power Tower, Bench, Cable Pulley, Bodyweight  
**Rest Days:** Thursday & Sunday

---

## Monday – Upper Body (Cable + Power Tower)

<!--
Reasoning:
- Compound movements (Push Up, Chest Press, Pull Up, Single Arm Cable Row) are placed first to maximize strength and energy for the heaviest, most demanding lifts.
- Isolation/accessory exercises (Triceps Pressdown, Dumbbell Lateral Raise, One Arm Cable Lateral Raise, Cable Biceps Curl, Wide Grip Lat Pulldown) follow, allowing you to focus on specific muscles after the main lifts.
- This order (compound → isolation) is supported by strength training best practices for safety, effectiveness, and progression.
- Always finish your session with a cooldown: 5-10 minutes of light cardio (e.g., walking), static stretching, and deep breathing to aid recovery and flexibility.
- Exercises utilize both cable machine and Power Tower for equipment variety and progression.
- All choices are beginner-friendly, progressive, and mapped to Garmin Connect for easy tracking.

## Tuesday – Lower Body (Cable + Bodyweight)

<!--
Reasoning:
- Compound exercises (Leg Press, Bodyweight Squat) are placed first to maximize strength and energy for the largest muscle groups.
- Isolation/accessory exercises (Leg Curl, Leg Extension, Calf Raise, Cable Kickback, Hip Adduction) follow, allowing you to focus on specific muscles after the main lifts.
- This order (compound → isolation) is supported by strength training best practices for safety, effectiveness, and progression.
- Always finish your session with a cooldown: 5-10 minutes of light cardio (e.g., walking), static stretching, and deep breathing to aid recovery and flexibility.
- Exercises use both cable machine and bodyweight for equipment variety and progression.
- All choices are beginner-friendly, progressive, and mapped to Garmin Connect for easy tracking.

## Wednesday – Core/Abs (Power Tower + Cable)

<!--
Reasoning:
- Core and abs exercises (Sit Up, Hanging Leg Raise, Plank, Cable Crunch, Russian Twist) are ordered from most demanding to least, starting with dynamic compound core work and ending with static holds and rotation.
- This order ensures you have the most energy for the hardest core moves and finish with stability and flexibility.
- Always finish your session with a cooldown: 5-10 minutes of light cardio (e.g., walking), static stretching, and deep breathing to aid recovery and flexibility.
- Exercises use Power Tower, cable, and bodyweight for variety and progression.
- All choices are beginner-friendly, progressive, and mapped to Garmin Connect for easy tracking.

## Beginner Guidance
- Warm up 5-10 minutes before each session (e.g., brisk walk, dynamic stretches).
- Focus on form, not weight. Start light and increase gradually.
- Rest 60-90 seconds between sets.
- If you can’t complete the reps, reduce weight or do fewer reps.
- Track your progress in Garmin Connect for motivation.
