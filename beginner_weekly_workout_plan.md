## Sunday – Rest

---

## Beginner Guidance
- Warm up 5-10 minutes before each session (e.g., brisk walk, dynamic stretches).
- Focus on form, not weight. Start light and increase gradually.
- Rest 60-90 seconds between sets.
- If you can’t complete the reps, reduce weight or do fewer reps.
- Track your progress in Garmin Connect for motivation.
